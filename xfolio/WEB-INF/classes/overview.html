     <h1>XFolio, JAVA overview</h1>
      <p>
 - XFolio don't want to be a java project and stay a pure Cocoon application but,
some features are not yet implemented in Cocoon project.
So, after long searching in source code, some lines are needed, usually only little
extends of already good design classes.
