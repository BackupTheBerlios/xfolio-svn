If nothing is working when you double-click on start.bat, heu, there's perhaps
a problem, mail me, but phone is perhaps a faster solution.

There's perhaps a problem in the java virtual machine.

If you see a black window with messages like "Started org.mortbay.jetty.Server@17a8bd",
it's better, a server is running.

Have a look in your browser, under the address
http://localhost/
If no documents are served (an error message like "org.apache.cocoon.ResourceNotFoundException")

Perhaps you need to say to the server where are the documents you want to serve

The documents served should be declared as an absolute path in the file
.../strabon/webapp/config.xmap
